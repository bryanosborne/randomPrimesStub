# The hunt for primes
A client has approached Wizard of Oz Solutions with the following unfinished Python program.

It is a partially completed program with the main and the checkPrime() function written, but critical list-based functions are incomplete.

Your mission is to complete the unfinished functions using what we have learned in class and in the textbook.

The following information is known:

The program’s main is relatively simple, calling functions to accomplish several goals:

loadNumberList(nbrOfNbrs:int, largestNbrValue:int)  – which will generate a specified number of pseudo-random numbers up to a certain value and return them in a list

findPrimes(checkList:list) – which receives a list of numbers and returns a list containing any prime numbers that were found in the list

findPrimes() uses checkPrime(num:int) – which determines if a number is prime or not, returning a TRUE if the number is prime and FALSE if it is not.

listDiff(firstList:list, secondList:list) – which compares two lists of numbers and returns a list that contains the values in the first list that are not present in the second list.

printList(listToPrint:list) – which will print the values contained in the list passed to it.

Your submitted code should be neat, tidy, and well-documented.

Good luck.
